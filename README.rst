Description
===========
VizAsm is a reverse-enineering-tool for Mach-O binaries (Mach and iOS).
It is capable of reading the Objective-C and C method calls and performing a security audit.
VizAsm comes with a few built-in filters that you can use but is also expandable with user written filters (easy to write with the help of the Filter Api).

The results of the security audit is visualized as a graph (viewable in `Gephi <http://gephi.org/>`_)
but can also be viewed as simple text.

VizAsm needs the help of the `Hopper Disassembler <http://hopperapp.com/>`_ to get the disassembly.
You can either run it as script from Hopper or export the .asm file and run the analysis from the command line.
